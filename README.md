# expense_tracker

A Basic Expense Tracking App Made with Flutter

When a user touches an input field, ensure that the keyboard opens gracefully and content is pushed up appropriately. You have also learned how to dynamically add extra padding to make sure all input fields are always accessible.

Furthermore, you have implemented the secure area concept to ensure that things like the device camera do not interfere with your user interface.

And of course, finally, we can select which platform we are working on, so we can run different code or show different widgets based on this platform information.
